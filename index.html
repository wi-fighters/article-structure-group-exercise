                Let me make one thing clear first. If you are a beginner programmer, this article is not meant to make
                you feel bad
                about the mistakes that you might be making but rather to make you aware of them, teach you to spot
                signs of them, and
                remind you to avoid them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have made these mistakes in the past and learned from each and every one of them. I am happy to have
                formed coding
                habits to help me avoid them. You should do too.
            </p>
            <p>
                These mistakes are not presented here in any particular order.

            <h2>1) Writing Code Without Planning</h2>
            <p>
                High-quality written content, in general, cannot be created easily. It requires careful thinking and
                research. High-quality programs are no exception.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing quality programs is a process with a flow: <br>
                <strong>Think</strong>.
                <strong>Research</strong>. <strong>Plan</strong>. <strong>Write</strong>.
                <strong>Validate</strong>. <strong>Modify</strong>. <br>
                Unfortunately, there is no good acronym for this. You need to create a habit to always go through
                the right amount of these activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest mistakes I have made as a beginner programmer was to start writing code right
                away without much
                thinking and researching. While this might work for a small stand-alone application, it has a big,
                negative effect on
                larger applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like you need to think before saying anything you might regret, you need to think before you
                code anything you
                might regret. Coding is also a way to communicate your thoughts.

                Here is my version of that quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>

            <p>
                Programming is mostly about reading previous code, researching what is needed and how it fits within
                the current system,
                and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The actual writing of lines of
                code is probably
                only 10% of the whole process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity
                that needs nurturing.
            </p>

            <h2>2) Planning Too Much Before Writing Code</h2>
            <p>
                Yes. Planning before jumping into writing code is a good thing, but even good things can hurt you
                when you do too much
                of them. Too much water might poison you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not look for a perfect plan. That does not exist in the world of programming. Look for a
                good-enough plan, something
                that you can use to get started. The truth is, your plan will change, but what it was good for is to
                force you into some
                structure that leads to more clarity in your code. Too much planning is simply a waste of your time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am only talking about planning small features. Planning all the features at once should simply be
                outlawed! It is what
                we call the <strong>Waterfall Approach</strong>, which is a system linear plan with distinct steps
                that are to be
                finished one by one.
                You can imagine how much planning that approach needs. This is not the kind of planning I am talking
                about here. The
                waterfall approach does not work for most software projects. Anything complicated can only be
                implemented with agile
                adaptations to reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing programs has to be a responsive activity. You will add features you would never have thought
                of in a waterfall
                plan. You will remove features because of reasons you would never have considered in a waterfall
                plan. You need to fix
                bugs and adapt to changes. You need to be agile.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, always plan your next few features. Do that very carefully because too little planning and
                too much planning
                can both hurt the quality of your code, and the quality of your code is not something you can risk.
            </p>

            <h2>3) Underestimating the Importance of Code Quality</h2>
            <p>
                If you can only focus on one aspect of the code that you write, it should be its
                <strong>readability</strong>.
                Unclear code is trash. It
                is not even recyclable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never underestimate the importance of code quality. Look at coding as a way to communicate
                implementations. Your main
                job as a coder is to clearly communicate the implementations of any solutions that you are
                working
                on.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favorite quotes about programming is:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who
                    knows
                    where you live.
                </p>

                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>Brilliant advice, John!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the small things matter. For example, if you are not consistent with your indentation and
                capitalization, you
                should simply lose your license to code.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Another simple thing is the use of long lines. Anything beyond 80 characters is much harder to
                read.
                You might be
                tempted to place some long condition on the same line to keep an if-statement block more
                visible. Do
                not do that. Just
                never go beyond the 80 character limit, ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the simple problems like these can be easily fixed with <strong>linting</strong> and
                <strong>formatting</strong> tools. In
                JavaScript, we have two excellent tools that work perfectly together: <strong>ESLint</strong>
                and
                <strong>Prettier</strong>. Do yourself a favor and always
                use them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are a few more mistakes related to code quality:
            </p>
            <p>
                — Using many lines in a function or a file. You should always break long code into smaller
                chunks
                that can be tested and
                managed separately. I personally think that any function that has more than 10 lines is just too
                long, but this is just
                a rule of thumb.
            </p>
            <p>
                — Using double negatives. Please do not not not do that.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Using double negatives is just very not not wrong
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                — Using short, generic, or type-based variable names. Give your variables descriptive and
                non-ambiguous names.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                — Hard-coding primitive strings and numbers without descriptions. If you want to write logic
                that
                depends on a fixed
                primitive string or number value, put that value in a constant and give it a good name.
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <pre>
    const <strong>answerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything</strong> = 42;

            </div>
            <p>
                — Using sloppy shortcuts and workarounds to avoid spending more time around simple problems. Do
                not
                dance around
                problems. Face your realities.
            </p>
            <p>
                — Thinking that longer code is better. Shorter code is better in most cases. Only write longer
                versions if they make the
                code more readable. For example, do not use clever one-liners and nested ternary expressions
                just to
                keep the code
                shorter, but also do not intentionally make the code longer when it does not need to be.
                Deleting
                unnecessary code is
                the best thing you can do in any program.

            <p>
                — The excessive use of conditional logic. Most of what you think needs conditional logic can be
                accomplished without it.
                Consider all the alternatives and pick exclusively based on readability. Do not optimize for
                performance unless you can
                measure. Related: avoid <strong><span class="underline"><a

            <h2>4) Picking the First Solution</h2>
            <p>
                When I was starting to program, I remember that when I got presented with a problem, I would
                find a
                solution and just
                immediately run with it. I would rush the implementation right away before thinking about
                the
                complexities and potential
                failures of my first identified solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the first solution might be tempting, the good solutions are usually discovered once
                you start
                questioning all the
                solutions that you find. If you cannot think of multiple solutions to a problem, that is
                probably a
                sign that you do not
                completely understand the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your job as a professional programmer is not to find a solution to the problem. It is to
                find the
                <strong>simplest</strong> solution to
                the problem. By “simple” I mean the solution has to work correctly and perform adequately
                but still
                be simple enough to
                read, understand, and maintain.
            </p>

                    There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple
                    that there
                    are
                    obviously no
                    deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
                    deficiencies.

            <h2>5) Not Quitting</h2>
            <p>
                Another mistake that I have made more often than I cared to admit is sticking with the
                first
                solution even after I
                identify that it might not be the simplest approach. This is probably psychologically
                related to the
                <strong>“not-quitting”</strong> mentality. This is a good mentality to have in most
                activities, but
                it should not apply to programming. In fact, when it
                comes to writing programs, the right mentality is <strong>fail early and fail
                    often</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The minute you begin doubting a solution, you should consider throwing it away and
                re-thinking the
                problem. This is true
                no matter how much you were invested in that solution. Source control tools like GIT can
                help you
                branch off and
                experiment with many different solutions. Leverage that.
